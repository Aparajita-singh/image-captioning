# image-captioning

## Overview

This project implements an image captioning system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). The system generates textual descriptions of images by leveraging the powerful features extracted by a pre-trained ResNet50 model for image understanding, combined with a recurrent language model for generating coherent captions.
